# Hi, I'm Jovie (WonderJiayi) 🌿  
### A hybrid Designer–Engineer exploring the connection between **human, nature, technology, and art**

---

## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me
I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Information Systems at Northeastern University, with a solid programming foundation and a multidisciplinary background. I am particularly interested in the intersection of **data analysis, system development, and the natural sciences**.

In both academic and project work, I use technology to understand and model real-world complexity—from biological behavior and ecological patterns to user activity data. Whether I am building full-stack applications, working with data models, or creating interactive tools, I aim to make data more intuitive and meaningful for insights and decision-making.

I have a long-standing interest in nature and life systems, especially in studying animals, ecology, and environmental data. I hope to bridge technology and the life sciences in the future, turning my passion for biology and nature into impactful digital products.
